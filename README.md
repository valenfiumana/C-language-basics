# C language basics 

This repository contains a collection of C programming exercises and tests focusing on topics such as strings, arrays, matrices, repetitive menus, loops, conditionals, and functions. These are fundamental concepts in C programming that are widely used in various applications, from system programming to data analysis and visualization.

## Contents
The repository includes the following resources:

* **Exercises**: A set of C programming exercises covering topics such as string manipulation, array sorting, matrix multiplication, repetitive menus, loops, conditionals, and function design. Each exercise includes a problem statement and a solution (in the form of a C source code file). You can use these exercises to practice and reinforce your skills in these important topics.
1. [Basic structures: printf, loops, conditionals, functions](./Basics/basic.md)
2. [Arrays & Strings](./Basics/arrays-strings.md)
3. [Matrix](./Basics/matrix.md)
4. [Rand()](./Random%20exercises/rand()/rand.md)
5. [Tests](./Tests%20-%20menu,%20files%20&%20functions/tests.md)

* **Tests**: A set of C programming tests covering topics such as string matching, array searching, matrix inversion, menu-driven programs, loops with multiple conditions, and function composition. Each test includes a set of questions and problems. Each tests should be solved within ah hour. You can use these tests to assess your skills in these topics, to simulate real-world programming scenarios, and to challenge yourself.
